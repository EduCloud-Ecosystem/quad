// Package provisioning defines the durable, idempotent job queue that fronts

// keeps a large class from exceeding host API rate limits, and the idempotency
// key makes each job individually retry-safe. The v1 implementation is
// Postgres-backed so the self-host footprint stays at a single datastore.
// See DESIGN.md sections 4 and 9.
